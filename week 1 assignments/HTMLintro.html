        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <h2>My name is Abby and I'm a student at Durham College! I'm in the 3 year Computer Systems Technology course!</h2>
        <h3>I come from Cornwall, and got into computers from my fasination with robots and how they may just take over the word.
            My theory as a kid was that if I created and worked on robots I wouldn't end up jobless and I could prevent them from taking over the world and my job. 
            I then got into coding in high school where I learned to code in the PythonIDLE. I made many memories and cool projects with friends.
            Other than computers, I enjoy art-- I love to be creative. I do my own nails and I draw!</h3>
